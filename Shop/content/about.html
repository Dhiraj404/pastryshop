<h3> History </h3>
<div class="column" style="background-color:#FF0000;">
<div class="row">
  
<p> Wonderland Pastries Shop was born at 2001. This shop was found and raised by Mike. But he has started selling cakes since before the Wonderland was born. He delivered the cakes whenever there was an order. Wonderland Pastries Shop became popular since 2012 when people were craving about rainbow cakes. Then Mike took that challenge to make the rainbow cake with his own way and recipe. Because of that, Wonderland Pastries won an "Favourite Pastries Shop 2012" award from government. The taste of our homemade cakes is guaranteed.</p>

<p> "Wonderland is my favorite shop since I was 10. I used to hate cakes. But since my mother bought me Cheddar Cheese Cakes then I tried it, I got addicted and always buy that cake everyday after school." </p>
